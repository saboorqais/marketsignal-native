# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# 
# ✅ DO use: SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (safe for mobile apps)
# ❌ DON'T use: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (dangerous!)
#
# The Service Role key bypasses all Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
# If extracted from your app bundle, it would compromise your entire database.
#
# For admin operations:
# - Create Supabase Edge Functions that use Service Role server-side
# - Mobile app calls these functions with user authentication
# - Server validates permissions before executing privileged operations
